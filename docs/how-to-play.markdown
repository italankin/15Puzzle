## 1. Basic rules

A classic 15 puzzle uses tiles with 15 numbers written on each and one empty slot. Tiles can be moved either vertically
or horizontally, if they stand next to empty space.

The goal of the game is to rearrange numbers on field into order.

Suppose we have starting position like this (8 tiles variant):

<p align="center"><img src="/assets/start.jpg" alt="Starting position" /></p>

So, to solve the puzzle we must arrange them in order:

<p align="center"><img src="/assets/end.jpg" alt="Final position" /></p>

There are many ways to reach the final position, one of them is solve puzzle row by row.

To start, we place number `1` on its place, then number `2`, then `3` and so on. For example, first row can be done this
way:

<p align="center"><img src="/assets/first-row.gif" alt="First row solve" /></p>

## 2. Controls

The game support 3 different types of controls: clicks, gestures and hover.

### 2.1. Clicks

Just click on a tile to make a move.

It is possible to move multiple tiles in a row (or column):

### 2.2. Gestures

Swipe on a tile(s) to move:

<p align="center"><img src="/assets/gesture-move.gif" alt="Move with gestures" /></p>

### 2.3. Hover

Hover is more advanced (and faster) way to solve the puzzle. Start by pressing and holding on the empty space, and then
move finger over the tiles you want to move.

<p align="center"><img src="/assets/hover.gif" alt="Hover method" /></p>

## 3. Game types

There are 3 game types: `classic`, `snake` and `spiral`. The game type can be changed in [Settings](#6-settings).

You can always view the final position of the game by pressing ‚ùì on the main screen:

<p align="center"><img src="/assets/how-to-play.jpg" alt="How to play" /></p>

### 3.1. Classic

Numbers arranged from left to right, top to bottom.

<p align="center"><img src="/assets/classic.jpg" alt="Classic mode" /></p>

### 3.2. Snake

Starting at top left corner go right, then next row from right to left, the third row arranged from left to right and so
on.

<p align="center"><img src="/assets/snake.jpg" alt="Snake mode" /></p>

### 3.3. Spiral

Start at top left corner, move right to the edge, then move from top to bottom, then from right to left, then from
bottom to top and so on.

<p align="center"><img src="/assets/spiral.jpg" alt="Spiral mode" /></p>

## 4. Game modes

There are 2 modes: `easy` and `hard`. It can be changed in [advanced settings](#62-advanced).

### 4.1. Easy

The default mode you start with.

### 4.2. Hard

In a hard mode the puzzle must be solved blindly - the player can see the numbers only the on first move. If any move is
done, numbers disappear from field.

To solve the puzzle, player must arrange numbers in their order, and then hit `check` button to check if they solved
puzzle correctly.

<p align="center"><img src="/assets/hard-check.gif" alt="Hard mode check" /></p>

If you find intimidating playing the hard mode, `peek` button comes to the rescue. Press and hold the button to show
numbers on tiles.

<p align="center"><img src="/assets/hard-peek.gif" alt="Hard mode peek" /></p>

## 5. Records

The fastest and most efficient solves are put to the Records.

The top panel of `Records` screen is interactive. There are `Type`, `Mode`, `Width` and `Height` filters, and two `Sort`
modes: `fewer moves` and `less time`.

The table shows place, moves count, time spent and date of the solve.

<p align="center"><img src="/assets/records.jpg" alt="Records" /></p>

### 5.1. Export

Records can be exported to a file in [CSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) format by
pressing `export` button.

The exported file contains the following information:

| type                       | hard mode                                        | width               | height               | time                                | moves          | date               |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------|----------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------|--------------------|
| [game type](#3-game-types) | `0` for easy mode, `1` for [hard mode](#42-hard) | width of the puzzle | height of the puzzle | time in seconds (with milliseconds) | count of moves | date of the record |

For example:

```
type;hard mode;width;height;time;moves;date
classic;0;4;4;40.619;127;5/1/21
classic;0;4;4;29.906;128;5/1/21
```

### 5.2. Import

Import previously [exported records](#51-export).

### 6.2.2. Missing tile

By `default`, the missing tile will be the last one (for 4x4 it's number 16, 9 for 3x3, 12 for 4x3 and so on). If set
to `random`, the tile will be chosen randomly and the goal will be different.

For example, in this position the missing tile is 6:

<p align="center"><img src="/assets/missing-tile-start.jpg" alt="Missing tile starting position" /></p>

So, you need to arrange tiles in this order:

<p align="center"><img src="/assets/missing-tile-goal.jpg" alt="Missing tile goal position" /></p>

## 7. Multi-color

Multi-color is a way the tiles on game field are colored.

| Mode       | Description                                        | Image                              |
|------------|----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| `off`      | All tiles colored by [chosen color](#61-basic)     | ![off](/assets/mc-off.jpg)         |
| `rows`     | Each row has different color                       | ![rows](/assets/mc-rows.jpg)       |
| `columns`  | Each column has different color                    | ![columns](/assets/mc-columns.jpg) |
| `fringe`   | Tiles colored by layers                            | ![fringe](/assets/mc-fringe.jpg)   |
| `fringe-3` | Same as `fringe`, but with more colors for columns | ![fringe](/assets/mc-fringe-3.jpg) |
| `solved`   | Solved tiles have a brighter color                 | ![solved](/assets/mc-solved.jpg)   |

## 8. Statistics

Statistics screen shows various information about current session, such
as [average](https://www.speedsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Average) times, moves
and [TPS](https://www.speedsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Turns_per_second).

<p align="center"><img src="/assets/stats.jpg" alt="Statistics" /></p>

Statistics can be enabled in [advanced settings](#62-advanced).

### 8.1. Export

Current session statistics can be exported to a file in [CSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values)
format by pressing `export` button.

The exported file contains the following information:

| type                       | hard mode                                        | width               | height               | time                                | moves          | tps                                                                 |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------|----------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [game type](#3-game-types) | `0` for easy mode, `1` for [hard mode](#42-hard) | width of the puzzle | height of the puzzle | time in seconds (with milliseconds) | count of moves | [TPS](https://www.speedsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Turns_per_second) |

For example:

```
type;hard mode;width;height;time;moves;tps
classic;0;4;4;11.732;78;6.648
classic;0;4;4;16.315;134;8.213
```
